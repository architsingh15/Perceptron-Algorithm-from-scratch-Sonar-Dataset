# Perceptron-Algorithm-from-scratch-Sonar-Dataset
Analysis of the Sonar Dataset using algorithm designed from scratch

First attempt on designing the simplest type of Aritifcial Neural Network
(can be used for real world classification, just tune the parameters according to the type of problem you have)
